## Project Description

This project explores the concept of a digital transmitter, how it operates, and how signals are generated and prepared for transmission through a communication channel.

### Main Activities:
1. **Designing a digital transmitter:**  
   - Creating a basic transmitter using Python.

2. **Implementation of modulation schemes:**  
   - Amplitude Modulation (AM).
   - Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK).
   - Frequency Modulation (FM).
   - Frequency Shift Keying (FSK).
   - Phase Shift Keying (PSK).  
   - Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).  

3. **Simulation of a communication channel with noise:**  
   - Implementing a channel with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).  
   - Analyzing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

4. **Evaluation of efficiency and robustness:**  
   - Assessing the energy efficiency of each modulation scheme.  
   - Analyzing noise resistance.
